3. Contacts (Players, coaches, etc.)
The next step is to enter contacts for your group(s). You probably only need to do this once per contact, ever.
This only enters them into the database. it doesn't mean they are committed to attending a tournament.

You have access to contacts in these groups:

4. Register Contacts for Tournament
Once you have entered all the contacts for your group(s), you can register them to attend the tournament. Be sure to
indicate which competitions they will enter. That's important for the team registration step.

5. Combine Registered Players into Teams
Once you have registered all the players for your district/league, you can combine them into teams.
